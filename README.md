# THE VEXED BALKANS
The Fates were unkind to the Balkan Peninsula. Because of its
position, it was forced to stand in the path of the greatest racial
movements of the world, and was thus the scene of savage racial
struggles, and the depositary of residual shreds of nations surviving
from great defeats or Pyrrhic victories and cherishing irreconcilable 
mutual hatreds. As if that were not enough of ill fortune imposed by
geographical position, the great Roman Empire elected to come from
its seat in the Italian Peninsula to die in the Balkan Peninsula, a long
drawn-out death of many agonies, of many bloody disasters and
desperate retrievals. For all the centuries of which history knows a
blood-mist has hung over the Balkans; and for the centuries before the dawn of written history one may surmise that
there was the same constant struggle of warring races.
It seems fairly certain that when the Northern peoples moved down
from their gloomy forests towards the Mediterranean littoral to mingle
their blood with the early peoples of the Minoan civilisation and to
found the Grecian and the Roman nations, the chief stream of these
fierce hordes moved down by the valley of the Danube and
debouched on the Balkan Peninsula. Doubtless they fought many a
savage battle with the aborigines in Thessaly and Thrace. Of these
battles we have no records, and no absolute certainty, indeed, that
the Mediterranean shore was colonised by a race from the North,
though all the facts that we are learning now from the researches of
modern archaeologists point to that conclusion. But whatever the
prehistoric state of the Balkan Peninsula, the first sure records from
written history show it as a vexed area peopled by widely different
and mutually warring races, and subject always to waves of war and
invasion from the outside. The Slav historian Jireček concludes that
the Balkan Peninsula was inhabited at the earliest times known to history by many different tribes belonging to distinct races—
the Thraco-Illyrians, the Thraco-Macedonians, and the ThracoDacians. At the beginning of the third century, the Slavs made their
first appearance and, crossing the Danube, came to settle in the
great plains between the river and the Balkan Mountains. Later, they
proceeded southwards and formed colonies among the ThracoIllyrians, the Roumanians, and the Greeks. This Slav emigration went
on for several centuries. In the seventh century of the Christian era a
Finno-ugric tribe reached the banks of the Danube. This tribe came
from the Volga, and, crossing Russia, proceeded towards ancient
Moesia, where it took possession of the north-east territory of the
Balkans between the Danube and the Black Sea. These were the 
Bulgars or Volgars, near cousins to the Turks who were to come
later. The Bulgars assumed the language of the Slavs, and some of
their customs. The Serbs or Serbians, coming from the Don River
district had been near neighbours of the Volgars or Bulgars (in the
Slav languages "B" and "V" have a way of interchanging), and were
without much doubt closely allied to them in race originally. Later,
they diverged, tending more to the Slav type, whilst the Bulgars approached nearer to the Turk type.
There may be traced, then, in the racial history of the Balkans these
race types: a Mediterranean people inhabiting the sea-coast and
possessing a fairly high civilisation, the records of which are being
explored now in the Cretan excavations; an aboriginal people
occupying the hinterland of the coast, not so highly cultivated as the
coast dwellers (who had probably been civilised by Egyptian
influences) but racially akin to them; a Northern people coming from
the shores of the Baltic and the North Sea before the period of written
history and combining ultimately with the people of the coast to found
the Grecian civilisation, leaving in the hinterland, as they passed
towards the sea, detachments which formed other mixed tribes, partly
aboriginal, partly Nordic; various invading peoples of Semitic type
from the Levant; the Romans, the Goths and the Huns, the Slavs and
the Tartars, the Bulgars and the Serbs, the Normans, Saracens, and
Turks. Because the Balkan Peninsula was on the natural path to a
warm-water port from the north to the south of Europe; because it
was on the track of invasion and counter-invasion between Asia and Europe, all this mixture of races was forced upon it, and as a
consequence of the mixture a constant clash of warfare. There was,
too, a current of more peaceful communication for purposes of trade
between the Levant and the Black Sea on the one side and the
peoples of the Baltic Sea on the other side, which flowed in part along
the Balkan Peninsula.
In Italy and her Invaders Mr. T. Hodgkin suggests:
During the interval from 540 to 480 b.c. there was a brisk commercial
intercourse between the flourishing Greek colonies on the Black Sea,
Odessos, Istros, Tyras, Olbia and Chersonesos—places now 
approximately represented by Varna, Kustendjix, Odessa, Cherson,
and Sebastopol—between these cities and the tribes to the northward
(inhabiting the country which has been since known as Lithuania), all
of whom at the time of Herodotus passed under the vague generic
name of Scythians. By this intercourse which would naturally pass up
the valleys of the great rivers, especially the Dniester and the
Dnieper, and would probably again descend by the Vistula and the
Niemen, the settlements of the Goths were reached, and by its
means the Ionian letter-forms were communicated to the Goths, to
become in due time the magical and mysterious Runes.
One fact which lends great probability to this theory is that
undoubtedly, from very early times, the amber deposits of the Baltic,
to which allusion has already been made, were known to the civilised
world; and thus the presence of the trader from the South among the settlements of
the Guttones or Goths is naturally accounted for. Probably also there
was for centuries before the Christian Era a trade in sables, ermines,
and other furs, which were a necessity in the wintry North and a
luxury of kings and nobles in the wealthier South. In exchange for
amber and fur, the traders brought probably not only golden staters
and silver drachmas, but also bronze from Armenia with pearls,
spices, rich mantles suited to the barbaric taste of the Gothic
chieftains. As has been said, this commerce was most likely carried
on for many centuries. Sabres of Assyrian type have been found in
Sweden, and we may hence infer that there was a commercial
intercourse between the Euxine and the Baltic, perhaps 1300 years
before Christ.
A few leading facts with dates should give a fairly clear impression of
the story of the Balkan Peninsula. About 400 b.c. the Macedonian
Empire was being founded. It represented the uprise of a hinterland
Greek people over the decayed greatness of the coast-dwelling
Greeks. At that time the northern part of the Balkan Peninsula was
occupied by the Getae or Dacians. Phillip of Macedon made an
alliance with the Getae. Alexander the Great of Macedonia thrashed
them to subjection and carried a great wave of invasion into Asia from
the Balkan Peninsula.
